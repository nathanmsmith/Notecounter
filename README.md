# Notecounter
A small python script that counts and categorizes every note of a midi file. Requires the [python-midi](https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi) library.

#Use
```
python notecounter.py yourfile.mid
```
I included `mary.mid` as a sample for you to play around with. Output should look like this:
```
File: mary.mid
Number of notes: 68
Breakdown:
c: 6
c#: 0
d: 20
d#: 0
e: 24
f: 0
f#: 0
g: 18
g#: 0
a: 0
a#: 0
b: 0
```
